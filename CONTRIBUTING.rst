Licensing/copyright issues
==========================

Note that I (Andy Lee) am planning to make a release of Call Map compatible
with PySide2, licensed under BSD 2-clause license. To contribute code to the
Call Map program, you must agree to allow your contribution to be licensed
under GPL-v3, and also BSD 2-clause license as part of any future release the
Call Map project that is PySide2-compatible.

Call Map is copyrighted to its developers, so that will include you if you
contribute.
